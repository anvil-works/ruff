    "Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes.

To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M<n>* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*"

Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this.\n    dtick: Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M<n>* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*\n    exponentformat: Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000.

If *B*, 1B. *SI* uses prefixes from \"femto\" f (10^-15) to \"tera\" T (10^12). *SI extended* covers instead the full SI range from \"quecto\" q (10^-30) to \"quetta\" Q (10^30). If *SI* or *SI extended* is used and the exponent is beyond the above ranges, the formatting rule will automatically be switched to the power notation.\n    gridcolor: Sets the color of the grid lines.\n    griddash: Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (*solid*, *dot*, *dash*, *longdash*, *dashdot*, or *longdashdot*) or a dash length list in px (eg *5px,10px,2px,2px*).\n    gridwidth: Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n    hoverformat: Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python.

For example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n    layer: Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with `cliponaxis` set to *false* to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis.\n    linecolor: Sets the axis line color.\n    linewidth: Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n    min: The minimum value visible on this axis. The maximum is determined by the sum minus the minimum values of the other two axes.

    ) -> None:
        "Create a new 'Caxis' object\n\nArgs:\n    color: Sets default for all colors associated with this axis all at once: line, font, tick, and grid colors. Grid color is lightened by blending this with the plot background Individual pieces can override this.\n    dtick: Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis. Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or special strings available to *log* and *date* axes. If the axis `type` is *log*, then ticks are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1, 10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ... set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. *log* has several special values; *L<f>*, where `f` is a positive number, gives ticks linearly spaced in value (but not position). For example `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = *L0.5* will put ticks at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10 plus small digits between, use *D1* (all digits) or *D2* (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is ignored for *D1* and *D2*. If the axis `type` is *date*, then you must convert the time to milliseconds. For example, to set the interval between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to 86400000.0. *date* also has special values *M<n>* gives ticks spaced by a number of months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set ticks on the 15th of every third month, set `tick0` to *2000-01-15* and `dtick` to *M3*. To set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to *M48*\n    exponentformat: Determines a formatting rule for the tick exponents. For example, consider the number 1,000,000,000. If *none*, it appears as 1,000,000,000. If *e*, 1e+9. If *E*, 1E+9. If *power*, 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If *SI*, 1G. If *B*, 1B. *SI* uses prefixes from \"femto\" f (10^-15) to \"tera\" T (10^12). *SI extended* covers instead the full SI range from \"quecto\" q (10^-30) to \"quetta\" Q (10^30). If *SI* or *SI extended* is used and the exponent is beyond the above ranges, the formatting rule will automatically be switched to the power notation.\n    gridcolor: Sets the color of the grid lines.\n    griddash: Sets the dash style of lines. Set to a dash type string (*solid*, *dot*, *dash*, *longdash*, *dashdot*, or *longdashdot*) or a dash length list in px (eg *5px,10px,2px,2px*).\n    gridwidth: Sets the width (in px) of the grid lines.\n    hoverformat: Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: *%h* for half of the year as a decimal number as well as *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*\n    labelalias: Replacement text for specific tick or hover labels. For example using {US: 'USA', CA: 'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada. The labels we would have shown must match the keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular ascii dash. That means you need to use −1 instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values (if desired) can include html-like tags or MathJax.\n    layer: Sets the layer on which this axis is displayed. If *above traces*, this axis is displayed above all the subplot's traces If *below traces*, this axis is displayed below all the subplot's traces, but above the grid lines. Useful when used together with scatter-like traces with `cliponaxis` set to *false* to show markers and/or text nodes above this axis.\n    linecolor: Sets the axis line color.\n    linewidth: Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.\n    min: The minimum value visible on this axis. The maximum is determined by the sum minus the minimum values of the other two axes. The full view corresponds to all the minima set to zero.\n    minexponent: Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this number. This only has an effect when `tickformat` is *SI* or *B*.\n    nticks: Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the particular axis. The actual number of ticks will be chosen automatically to be less than or equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if `tickmode` is set to *auto*.\n    separatethousands: If \"true\", even 4-digit integers are separated\n    showexponent: If *all*, all exponents are shown besides their significands. If *first*, only the exponent of the first tick is shown. If *last*, only the exponent of the last tick is shown. If *none*, no exponents appear.\n    showgrid: Determines whether or not grid lines are drawn. If *true*, the grid lines are drawn at every tick mark.\n    showline: Determines whether or not a line bounding this axis is drawn.\n    showticklabels: Determines whether or not the tick labels are drawn.\n    showtickprefix: If *all*, all tick labels are displayed with a prefix. If *first*, only the first tick is displayed with a prefix. If *last*, only the last tick is displayed with a suffix. If *none*, tick prefixes are hidden.\n    showticksuffix: Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.\n    tick0: Sets the placement of the first tick on this axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is *log*, then you must take the log of your starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to 100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If the axis `type` is *date*, it should be a date string, like date data. If the axis `type` is *category*, it should be a number, using the scale where each category is assigned a serial number from zero in the order it appears.\n    tickangle: Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.\n    tickcolor: Sets the tick color.\n    tickfont: Sets the tick font.\n    tickformat: Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3 formatting mini-languages which are very similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format. And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to d3's date formatter: *%h* for half of the year as a decimal number as well as *%{n}f* for fractional seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with tickformat *%H~%M~%S.%2f* would display *09~15~23.46*\n    ticklabelstep: Sets the spacing between tick labels as compared to the spacing between ticks. A value of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A larger value n means only every nth tick is labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are shown. Not implemented for axes with `type` *log* or *multicategory*, or when `tickmode` is *array*.\n    ticklen: Sets the tick length (in px).\n    tickmode: Sets the tick mode for this axis. If *auto*, the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If *linear*, the placement of the ticks is determined by a starting position `tick0` and a tick step `dtick` (*linear* is the default value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If *array*, the placement of the ticks is set via `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`. (*array* is the default value if `tickvals` is provided).\n    tickprefix: Sets a tick label prefix.\n    ticks: Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If **, this axis' ticks are not drawn. If *outside* (*inside*), this axis' are drawn outside (inside) the axis lines.\n    ticksuffix: Sets a tick label suffix.\n    ticktext: Sets the text displayed at the ticks position via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to *array*. Used with `tickvals`.\n    tickvals: Sets the values at which ticks on this axis appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set to *array*. Used with `ticktext`.\n    tickwidth: Sets the tick width (in px).\n    uirevision: Controls persistence of user-driven changes in axis `min`, and `title` if in `editable: true` configuration. Defaults to `ternary<N>.uirevision`."
